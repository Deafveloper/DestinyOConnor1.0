<H1>ABOUT ME</H1>
<p>I’m currently developing my portfolio website

    I’m currently learning Javascript for Front-end Web Development  
    
    I’m looking forward to working with fellow Deaf developers 
    
    I am at the toddler stage of programming. I’m not a newbie but I am at the terrible 3s I fuck up a lot. 
    I knocked the street lights out on company website I was hired for. I saved myself by tracking down 
    the original developer that built the website. I still don’t know what I did to cause the blackout. 
    0_0 I am on my way to fuck up some more shit. I am SteveUrkle in the tech world. “Did I do that?!”</p>
