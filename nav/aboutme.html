<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Destiny, and I am a passionate software developer with a unique perspective. 
    I am deaf, which has given me a deep appreciation for the power of technology and its ability to connect people across barriers.
    I have always been fascinated by software development and started teaching myself to code several years ago. 
    I have since been able to develop my skills and am now focused on becoming a QA tester.
    In addition to my software development pursuits, I also have four years of experience as a webmaster. 
    This experience has given me a strong understanding of web development, which I can leverage in my future endeavors.
    As someone who has experienced the power of technology firsthand, I am committed to using my skills to create inclusive and accessible software. 
    I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer and can't wait to see where my journey takes me.</p>
